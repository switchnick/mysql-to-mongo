# mysql-to-mongo
A tool for migrating data from mysql to mongodb.

This tool is in it's initial stages. It has been designed to make the migration of data from MySql to MongoDB 
as simple and painless as possible while remaining highly configurable. All MySql relationships are maintained 
and Ids replace with native Mongo Ids. 

For added control it is possible to add custom scripts to modify schema and row information during migration 
as well as Post Migration scripts.

The UI is primitive at present but it's all a work in progress.
